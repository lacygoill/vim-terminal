" Why do you install a mapping whose lhs is `Esc Esc`?{{{
"
" In Vim, we can't use `esc` in the  lhs of a mapping, because any key producing
" a  sequence of  keycodes  containing Esc,  would be  subject  to an  undesired
" remapping (`M-b`, `M-f`, `Left`, `Right`, ...).
"
" Example:
" `M-b` produce Escape (enter Terminal-Normal mode) + b (one word backward).
" We *do* want to go one word backward, but we also want to stay in Terminal-Job
" mode.
"}}}
" Why do you use an autocmd and buffer-local mappings?{{{
"
" When fzf opens a terminal buffer, we don't want our mapping to be installed.
"
" Otherwise,  we need  to press  Escape  twice, then  press `q`;  that's 3  keys
" instead of one single Escape.
"
" We need our `Esc  Esc` mapping in all terminal buffers,  except the ones whose
" filetype is fzf; that's why we use a buffer-local mapping (when removed,
" it only affects the current buffer), and that's why we remove it in an autocmd
" listening to `FileType fzf`.
"}}}
" Do you need to do all of that in Neovim too?{{{
"
" No, Neovim doesn't suffer from this issue.
"
" So, to  go from Terminal-Job mode  to Terminal-Normal mode, we  could use this
" mapping:
"
"     exe 'tno <buffer> '.(has('nvim') ? '<esc>' : '<esc><esc>').' <c-\><c-n>'
"
" But I  prefer to  stay consistent:  double Escape  in Vim  â†’ double  escape in
" Neovim.
"}}}
" TODO: Find a way to send an Escape key to the foreground program running in the terminal.{{{
"
" Maybe something like this:
"
"     exe "set <m-[>=\e["
"     tno  <m-[>  <esc>
"
" It doesn't work, but you get the idea.
